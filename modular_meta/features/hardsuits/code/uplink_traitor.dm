			that runs off standard atmospheric tanks and an advanced team location system. Toggling the suit in and out of \
			combat mode will allow you all the mobility of a loose fitting uniform without sacrificing armoring. \
			Additionally the suit is collapsible, making it small enough to fit within a backpack. \
			Nanotrasen crew who spot these suits are known to panic."
