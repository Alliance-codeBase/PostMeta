//Spy unique items. \
	In pr #92481 some few cool spy items were added, since spy is a quite disliked antagonist out here, \
	usually being either exchanged for an regular traitor or rather disabled by admins completely, we're going to add his items here. \
	editing whole category "spy_unique" would cause some issues, due it having rocket launcher, bulldog shotgun and other quite impressive items.\
	Genuinely, you do not want a traitor running around with an rocket launcher killing people \
	So, what're we going to do, is to add all the funny items down here one by one.
