/*Spy unique items.
	In pr #92481 some few cool spy items were added, since spy is a quite disliked antagonist out here,
	usually being either exchanged for an regular traitor or rather disabled by admins completely, we're going to add his items here.
	editing whole category "spy_unique" would cause some issues, due it having rocket launcher, bulldog shotgun and other quite impressive items.
	Genuinely, you do not want a traitor running around with an rocket launcher killing people
	So, what're we going to do, is to add all the funny items down here one by one.
